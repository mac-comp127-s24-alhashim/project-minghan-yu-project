### Description
Shooting game is a game where players control a character shooting enemies from all directions. If enemies touch the player, the player is harmed and loses a certain amount of health. The game uses simple controls: WASD keys for movement and arrow keys for shooting in 4 directions. The game features various difficulty levels. Easier levels will have fewer enemies and slower pace, harder ones are the opposite. The winning condition is based on scoring points by shooting enemies. Once a player accumulates a sufficient number of points, they win, and the game ends. Players can choose to quit the game or try different levels instead. Conversely, if the player health turn 0, they lose, and the game ends. 

Inspired by Counter-Strike (https://www.counter-strike.net), a popular first-person shooting game, we incorporated a diverse weaponry system where different weapons inflict varying degrees of damage. Given the constraints of not using a game engine for a 3D implementation, we opted for a simplified 2D map representation.

### Implementation and Responsibility Plan
To complete this project, collaboration is key. Our plan unfolds in the following phases:

 - **Week 1:** Build the general framework of the game, focusing on class decomposition to outline the structure of the game, including player, weapons, enemies, and game mechanics.
 - **Week 2:** Continue with method decomposition, integrating graphics to represent the player, various weapons, and enemies. This phase also includes finalizing the game's controls and mechanics.
 - **Following:** Focus on debugging and refining the game. This includes ensuring the game mechanics are smooth, the scoring system is fair, and the difficulty levels are well-balanced.
