### Implementation and Responsibility Plan
To complete this project, collaboration is key. Our plan unfolds in the following phases:

 - **Week 1:** Build the general framework of the game, focusing on class decomposition to outline the structure of the game, including player, weapons, enemies, and game mechanics.
 - **Week 2:** Continue with method decomposition, integrating graphics to represent the player, various weapons, and enemies. This phase also includes finalizing the game's controls and mechanics.
 - **Following:** Focus on debugging and refining the game. This includes ensuring the game mechanics are smooth, the scoring system is fair, and the difficulty levels are well-balanced.
